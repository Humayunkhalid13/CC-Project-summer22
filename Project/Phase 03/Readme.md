<h2> Project Report </h2>

<h2>Introduction:<h2>
Our project is all about ChocoPy compiler. This compiler is used for educating students on how to construct a compiler. The compiler for ChocoPy is implemented to generate assembly code. ChocoPy compiler advantagous to use when teaching compiler since it is a simplified subset of python.
We have build this project using LEX (Lexical analyzer generator) and YACC (Yet another compiler compiler), lex and yacc are tools are use to generate lexical analyzers and parsers.

<h2>Objective:<h2>
The main objective of the project is to learn and practically implement the concept of compiler construction.

<h2>Conceptuals:<h2>
We have applied to main concepts in this project as required:
1. Lexical Analyzer:
In this phase white spaces and comments are remove from program and help us to identify the tokens. The input characters are read by lexical analyzers from the source code.
2. Syntax Analyzer:
In this phase a syntax analyzer takes the input from a lexical analyzer in the form of token to detect any error in the code. The output of this phase is parse tree.

<h2>Language Use In Project:<h2>
We have use C language for generating tokens which translates a program written in C language in to python. For this purpose we have used ChocoPy which can easily compiled a target. ChocoPy programes can also modified using python syntax highlighting. This language is fully specified using formal grammers, typing rules and operational semantics.

<h2>What are Lexical Tokens?<h2>
Lexical tokens are:
1. Identifier
2. Keyword
3. Operator
4. Delimeters
5. Literals
6. Comments
7. White spaces
8. Newline

<h2>Problems Faced:<h2>
<h3>Compiling Yacc program:<h3>
When we compile our lex and yacc files we got so many errors and we have no idea about theese errors because of a new environment.

<h2>Solution:<h2>
We have read many research papers and guided books and then finally we solved that problem.
