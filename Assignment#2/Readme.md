### <h2> First Problem: </h2>
When ever we are checking any international number(not have an R.E that gives maximum input for international numbers) it gives the output of invalid input but on other numbers it given us valid input. To solve and check that all the numbers that are valid or not we come up with a solution.
### Solution:
We use kleene closure to solve this issue.

### <h2> Second Problem: </h2>
The code is not giving valid for all the international standards extension of an gmail.
### Solution: 
We assume and set some international standards by our own like: .com .net etc that system can check valid for all international gmails and work properly.
